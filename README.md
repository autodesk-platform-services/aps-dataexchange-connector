## Overview

This sample application demonstrates the integration of the **Autodesk Data Exchange SDK** with a Windows desktop application using WPF. It showcases how to:

-   Embed the Data Exchange Connector UI within your application
-   Implement PKCE OAuth2 authentication with Autodesk Platform Services
-   Create and manage data exchanges programmatically
-   Handle multiple 3D file formats (STEP, IFC, OBJ, Mesh API)
-   Provide real-time progress feedback and notifications
-   Implement custom read/write models for exchange operations

**Target Audience**: Developers building Windows desktop applications that need to integrate with Autodesk's construction and design workflows.

## Features

### üé® **Connector UI Integration**

-   Integrate Data Exchange Connector UI within your WPF or WinForm application
-   Real-time notifications and progress tracking
-   Integrated 3D model preview for exchange selection

### üîê **Authentication & Security**

-   PKCE OAuth2 implementation with APS (Autodesk Platform Services)

### üîÑ **Exchange Management**

-   Create new exchanges with custom metadata
-   Update existing exchanges with new revisions
-   Download and cache exchange data locally
-   Search and filter exchanges with advanced criteria

## Screenshots

### Home Screen with Exchange Creation

The Connector UI provides a comprehensive workflow with four distinct screens:

-   **Home Screen**: Entry point with project and exchange navigation
-   **Tooltip Notifications**: Real-time feedback and status updates
-   **Create Exchange**: Interactive creation workflow
-   **Exchange Management**: Browse and manage existing exchanges

### Integrated 3D Preview

View and inspect 3D models directly within the Connector UI using the APS Viewer, without leaving the application interface.

## Prerequisites

### Development Environment

-   **Visual Studio 2019** or later (recommended: Visual Studio 2022)
-   **.NET Framework 4.8** or **.NET 8.0** SDK
-   **Windows 10** or later (x64 architecture)

### Autodesk Platform Services

1. **APS Developer Account**: [Register here](https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps/)

2. **Application Registration**: Create an app with the following scopes:

    - Data Management API
    - Data Exchange API

3. **Autodesk Construction Cloud**: Active ACC account to store created exchange or load exchanges from

### Required Credentials

-   **Client ID**: From your APS application
-   **Callback URL**: Default: `http://127.0.0.1:63212/`

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-dataexchange-connector.git
cd aps-dataexchange-connector
```

### 2. Install Data Exchange SDK

Follow the [official SDK installation guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/dx-sdk-beta/v1/developers_guide/installing_the_sdk/#procedure) to add the NuGet package source in Visual Studio.

### 3. Restore NuGet Packages

1. Open `src/SampleConnector.sln`
2. Right-click on the solution ‚Üí **Restore NuGet Packages**
3. Build the solution (`Ctrl+Shift+B`)

## Configuration

### 1. Application Configuration

Edit `src/App.Debug.config` (for Debug builds) or `src/App.Release.config` (for Release builds):

```xml
<configuration>
    <appSettings>
        <add key="AuthClientId" value="YOUR_CLIENT_ID" />
        <add key="AuthCallback" value="http://127.0.0.1:63212/" />
        <add key="ConnectorName" value="Your Connector Name" />
        <add key="ConnectorVersion" value="1.0.0" />
        <add key="HostApplicationName" value="Your Host App" />
        <add key="HostApplicationVersion" value="1.0.0" />
        <add key="LogLevel" value="Info" />
    </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

### 2. Configuration Parameters

| Parameter                | Description                     | Required |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| `AuthClientId`           | APS application Client ID       | ‚úÖ Yes   |
| `AuthCallback`           | OAuth2 redirect URI             | ‚úÖ Yes   |
| `ConnectorName`          | Display name for your connector | ‚ùå No    |
| `ConnectorVersion`       | Version of your connector       | ‚ùå No    |
| `HostApplicationName`    | Name of your host application   | ‚ùå No    |

## Usage

### 1. Launch the Application

1. Build and run the solution from Visual Studio
2. The application opens a web browser for APS authentication
3. Sign in with your Autodesk credentials
4. The Connector UI appears within the sample application

### 2. Create an Exchange

1. Click **Create Exchange** in the UI
